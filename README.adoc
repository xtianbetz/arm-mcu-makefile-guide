= ARM MCU Makefile Guide
:toc: left

STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

A minimalist guide and skeleton for building, running, and debugging firmware
for ARM-based microcontrollers using C, GCC, OpenOCD, and GDB.

== Goals for this Guide

* Demonstrate a minimal Makefile-based solution for building an
  extremely simple LED-blinking firmware for an ARM microcontroller (MCU).
* Demonstrate a build/test/debug workflow that works entirely from the
  CLI on Linux (and eventually Mac)
* The workflow described here should be easily adaptable to a continuous
  integration system such as Jenkins. In other words, it should be
  straightforward to automate building and publishing firmware binary
  release-candidates automatically following code review (i.e. no humans ever
  hand-build the official firmware files which are tested and then released).
* Teach the basic concepts of MCU development to programmers already familiar
  with C programming on Linux/Mac.

== Why not use the vendor-recommended IDEs?

- The classic vendor-supported methods of developing firmware for MCUs is using
  a full-blown IDE like Keil, IAR, or MCU Eclipse.
- These legacy IDE-based tools are GUI-based and can be proprietary and/or
  expensive. They have their own learning curves as they are advanced tools for "serious professionals".
- The advanced GUI-based tools obscure the basic basic underlying concepts
  which aren't really that complicated!
