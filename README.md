STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS. NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

A minimalist guide and skeleton for building, running, and debugging
firmware for ARM-based microcontrollers using C, GCC, OpenOCD, and GDB.

Goals for this Guide
====================

-   Demonstrate a minimal Makefile-based solution for building an
    extremely simple LED-blinking firmware for an ARM microcontroller
    (MCU).

-   Demonstrate a build/test/debug workflow that works entirely from the
    CLI on Linux (and eventually Mac)

-   The workflow described here should be easily adaptable to a
    continuous integration system such as Jenkins. In other words, it
    should be straightforward to automate building and publishing
    firmware binary release-candidates automatically following code
    review (i.e. no humans ever hand-build the official firmware files
    which are tested and then released).

-   Teach the basic concepts of MCU development to programmers already
    familiar with C programming on Linux/Mac.

Why not use the vendor-recommended IDEs?
========================================

-   The classic vendor-supported methods of developing firmware for MCUs
    is using a full-blown IDE like Keil, IAR, or MCU Eclipse.

-   These legacy IDE-based tools are GUI-based and can be proprietary
    and/or expensive. They have their own learning curves as they are
    advanced tools for "serious professionals".

-   The advanced GUI-based tools obscure the basic basic underlying
    concepts which arenâ€™t really that complicated!
